# Minishell
Minishell is a lightweight implementation of the Unix shell designed for educational purposes at 42 School. Our goal is to provide students hands-on experience developing a command interpreter capable of handling input, output, and executing commands.

## Getting Started
To begin working on the minishell project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository onto your local machine:

```
git clone [https://github.com/rabatm/minishell.git](https://github.com/rabatm/42_Minishell)
cd minishell
```

Install dependencies required for building the project, which typically include Make and Git tools. 

On Ubuntu, run:
```
sudo apt install make git
```
Compile the source files to generate the binary executable named minishell, located inside the build directory:
```
make
./minishell
```

## Usage
Type commands directly into the terminal window running the minishell application. To exit the mini-shell, enter the following command followed by pressing Enter:
```
exit
```

## Built With
GNU Make: Used for managing builds, compilation, and dependency resolution.
