# Minishell
Minishell is a lightweight implementation of the Unix shell designed for educational purposes at 42 School. Our goal is to provide students hands-on experience developing a command interpreter capable of handling input, output, and executing commands.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository onto your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/&lt;username>/minishell.git
cd minishell
Install dependencies required for building the project, which typically include Make and Git tools. On Ubuntu, run:

sudo apt install make git
Compile the source files to generate the binary executable named minishell, located inside the build directory:

make
./minishell
Usage
Type commands directly into the terminal window running the minishell application. To exit the mini-shell, enter the following command followed by pressing Enter:

exit
Built With
